        This function does a few things, first it creates frames, so that each frame is like a region in the 
        800 by 500 App. This helps with the organisation of content, in this case there is only one frame with tabs
        as its primary layout. But if for example you need to add buttons, you just create a new frame and you're not
        bound by the tab layout or the table layout

        I created the tab using the Notebook api from ttk. You can read about it in 
            https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/tkinter.Notebook
